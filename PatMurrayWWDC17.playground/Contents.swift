 # Draw My Tune
 #### Created by **Patrick Murray** for a WWDC17 Scholarship Application
 'Draw My Tune' is an awesome (but also somewhat awkward) little experiment in combining a drawing tool with a music sampler. It allows you to *"play"* your 2D line drawings.
 

 > To run *Draw My Tune* please make usre the Timeline view is visible in the assistant editor and make sure the device volume is above zero (but also not too loud, because I bet some of your drawings will sound terribleâ€”no offense ðŸ™ƒ.)
